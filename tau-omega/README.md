# Omega is a serverless execution engine for Tau

User defined code execution is critical for any rule based platform i.e. when the rule
matches execute the code defined by the user.

This can allow for building simple apps that are nothing more than a chain of rules
responding to events and executing custom code.

There are 2 types of executors in Omega:
1. script based executors
2. code based executors

# Supported Languages

Currently anything compliant with JSR223 can be added to the execution platform for script executor.
